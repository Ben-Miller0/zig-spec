# Grammar

This folder contains the [Parsing Expression Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) for the Zig programming language.

## Build

The grammar is validated and tested using the [`peg` parser generator](http://piumarta.com/software/peg/) and any C compiler (TODO: We should probably know the version of compileres required).

Typing `make` in this folder will create a `build` directory containing the source files generated from `peg` and two executables, which can both parse Zig source code.

* The `parser` executable will parse content from stdin. It exits with the status code `1` if the input is not valid Zig.
* `parser_debug` does the same as `parser` but also prints to stderr which rules are taken during parsing.
